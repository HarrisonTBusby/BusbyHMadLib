# BusbyHMadLib


This is a mad lib

Using a while loop, if statement, string interpolation, and data validation, and user input. The user creates a story.

Peer reviewed by: Marcel R. Program ran well. really heartful story with the right inputs. It has playagain and data validation. The only comment I have would be to tell the user what to type to play again. Other than that, great work!
